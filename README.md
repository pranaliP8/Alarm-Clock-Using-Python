# Alarm-Clock-Using-Python
About The Python Project:
It includes some essential libraries such as Date time and TKinter, which assist us in constructing a project utilizing the current date and time. 

Prerequisites:
This project requires good knowledge of Python and GUI (Graphic User Interface). By combining Python and Tkinter, you can create GUI applications quickly and easily. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. All modules used do not need to be pre-downloaded like other libraries such as NumPy, making this project easy to use and accessible in any virtual environment used for Python programming.

Modules Used:
1.Python -
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures. Combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.

2.Tkinter – 
Python offers multiple choices for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI strategies, tkinter is that the most ordinarily used technique. It’s a customary Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.

3.Time module – 
Time module in Python provides varied time-related functions. This module comes with Python’s normal modules.

4.Datetime and time modules -
 These modules will allow us to handle dates and times and help us manipulate them whenever required.The main focus of datetime is to form it simpler to access   attributes of the thing associated with dates, times, and time zones.

Winsound module -
 The winsound module provides access to the essential sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. It includes functions and a number of other constants.
